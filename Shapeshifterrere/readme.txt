Mods/Mod Components Required for this mod to function:
Tweaks Anthology "Shapeshifter Rebalancing"

What this mod does:
	-Adjusts the "Shapeshifter Rebalancing" component of the Tweaks Anthology.
		-Changes:
			-Greater Bearweres' regeneration rate is halved (these are too strong in melee, even with the existence of Death Spell)
			-Greater Werewolf (Shapeshifter shape) regeneration rate is reduced by 33% (the form should be strong in melee, but that level of regeneration can make the shapeshifter effectively immortal)..
			-Greater Werewolf Paw is no longer a two-handed weapon (this never made much sense and locked shapeshifter druids at 3 APR - werecreatures in hybrid form can wield weapons - why not shapeshifters?)
			-Reverts the changes to the shapeshifter kit from SCS to the changes from Tweaks.
